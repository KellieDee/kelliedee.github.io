            <img src="images/comp1.png">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>I've always had a difficult time with the position, top, bottom, left, right, and z-index properties, which I previously encountered in several JavaScript plugins (like image carousels). Building a simple header that sticks to the top of the page will allow me to practice the aformentioned CSS properties and learn the difference between position values (e.g. fixed and absolute).</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Headers are vital page elements containing crucial tools that guide user actions. Often, these include (but are not limited to): an escape hatch (usually in the form of a logo),  a search bar, account login/details, and main navigation. Keeping this information above the fold allows users to quickly navigate the website without having to scroll or jump to the very top of the page. Using JavaScript, I can refine the header to display in the center of the screen and only affix to the top of the page if the user scrolls far enough down.</p>

                <h3>Feature-Rich Navigation Menu</h3>
            </header>
            <img src="images/comp2.png">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>I can honestly say I've never made a navigation menu that goes beyond single or nested unordered lists, so building a feature-rich menu with multiple lists, images, and/or advertisments is an adequate challenge for me this month. Brief research shows that most HTML tags can be contained within a list item. I will likely revisit familiar elements (lists, divs, sections, block-level elements, etc.) and put them to use in exciting new ways.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Long and verbose navigation menus take up valuable screen space and can overwhelm users. This is one of the first areas users will explore to find content on a website, so it should be categorized and labeled well, while still remaining succinct. Feature-rich navigation menus offer users more content and clarity in a smaller (and sometimes hidden, if using the hover pseudoclass) amount of space: great for both the client and the customer. Upon learning more server-side languages, I could use the additional navigation space to hold account information, shopping cart checkout, or advanced search features.</p>

                <h3>Full-Screen Call-to-Action (CTA)</h3>
            </header>
            <img src="images/comp3.png">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>In previous courses, I learned how to design effective calls-to-action, but not code them. With as much frustration as I get from trying to find an appropriate, high-quality image to use for the background, I don't often put CTAs to use in my pages. I want to revisit what I already know, and expand upon my skills so that I can create a full-screen, filtered, and responsive call-to-action with added text, buttons, and/or search features to serve as focal points.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>A call-to-action is very important when a Web developer wants to encourage a user to take a specific action. This can take the form of a button, form, or input field positioned above a large hero image. Attractive images that take center stage above the fold garner attention and--with the help of color and other styling effects--convert Web traffic into memberships, sales, and/or dedicated, return users. I can expand on this concept to add a timed image slider, animation, or video.</p>
