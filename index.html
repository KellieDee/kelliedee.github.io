        <h2>About the Designer</h2>
        <p>Greetings! I'm KellieDee and I'm an aspiring web designer and developer stuck in the cornfields of Iowa. I've been building websites as a hobby since I was 14 years old. I enrolled at Full Sail to polish and expand my skills with the ultimate goal of helping small businesses maximize their presence on the Web. Work and school don't leave me with a lot of spare time, but when I am free, I enjoy gaming, traveling, baking, art, casual tennis, spending time with friends, and cuddling with the best cat on the planet.</p>

                <h3>Sticky Header</h3>
            </header>
            <img src="images/comp1.png" alt="Fixed Header">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>I've always had a difficult time with the position, top, bottom, left, right, and z-index properties, which I previously encountered in several JavaScript plugins (like image carousels). Building a simple header that sticks to the top of the page will allow me to practice the aformentioned CSS properties and learn the difference between position values (e.g. fixed and absolute).</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Headers are vital page elements containing crucial tools that guide user actions. Often, these include (but are not limited to): an escape hatch (usually in the form of a logo), a search bar, account login/details, and main navigation. Keeping this information above the fold allows users to quickly navigate the website without having to scroll or jump to the very top of the page. Using JavaScript, I can refine the header to display in the center of the screen and only affix to the top of the page if the user scrolls far enough down.</p>

            </header>
            <img src="images/comp2.png" alt="Mega Menu with Images, Lists, and Text">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>I can honestly say I've never made a navigation menu that goes beyond single or nested unordered lists, so building a feature-rich menu with multiple lists, images, and/or advertisments is an adequate challenge for me this month. Brief research shows that most HTML tags can be contained within a list item. I will likely revisit familiar elements (lists, divs, sections, block-level elements, etc.) and put them to use in exciting new ways.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Long and verbose navigation menus take up valuable screen space and can overwhelm users. This is one of the first areas users will explore to find content on a website, so it should be categorized and labeled well, while still remaining succinct. Feature-rich navigation menus offer users more content and clarity in a smaller (and sometimes hidden, if using the hover pseudoclass) amount of space: great for both the client and the customer. Upon learning more server-side languages, I could use the additional navigation space to hold account information, shopping cart checkout, or advanced search features.</p>

                <h3>Full-Screen Call-to-Action</h3>
            </header>
            <img src="images/comp3.png" alt="Full-Screen CTA with Buttons">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>In previous courses, I learned how to design effective calls-to-action, but not code them. With as much frustration as I get from trying to find an appropriate, high-quality image to use for the background, I don't often put CTAs to use in my pages. I want to revisit what I already know, and expand upon my skills so that I can create a full-screen, filtered, and responsive call-to-action with added text, buttons, and/or search features to serve as focal points.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>A call-to-action is very important when a Web developer wants to encourage a user to take a specific action. This can take the form of a button, form, or input field positioned above a large hero image. Attractive images that take center stage above the fold garner attention and--with the help of color and other styling effects--convert Web traffic into memberships, sales, and/or dedicated, return users. I can expand on this concept to add a timed image slider, animation, or video.</p>

                <h3>Company Contact/Details</h3>
            </header>
            <img src="images/comp4.png" alt="Team Details with Nameplates">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>Aside from changing the color on buttons and links in hover state, I have yet to use CSS to manipulate images on mouse enter and exit. Placing information over images likely requires use of the display and z-index properties, the latter still fairly new to me. I would like to practice the creation of filters and positioning of text, images, and links upon hovering over an image.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Typical Web users don't take the time to read every detail presented to them, often scanning the page in an F shape pattern (since the most essential content exists towards the top). Company contact/details are generally not popular enough to be placed in prime locations on the page; extranenous, non-essential information has a higher chance of being looked over. Using images instead of text adds visual interest for users, and allowing details to be stored in a hover state saves page space for developers. This feature can be built upon to add links in place of textual information. (e.g. e-mail, website, social media, web call, etc.)</p>

            <img src="images/comp5.png" alt="Testimonials with Paginated Carousel">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>When it comes to dynamically displaying information hidden behind content boxes, I have zero success. I have yet to develop a functioning carousel on my own--even with frameworks and plugins, I still struggle. This particular paginated testimonial seems like it will provide the appropriate level of challenge. It will help me learn how to dynamically display hidden content with the use of navigation controls (e.g. pagination, click and drag) and JavaScript animation and/or CSS transitions.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Pagination is an excellent alternative for displaying content on the Web--and even some mobile devices. Lengthy product and service reviews in list format are best left to large e-commerce sites like Amazon; succinct responses can be displayed with more emphasis and style. What better way to save some screen real estate in the process than with a paginated carousel? JavaScript timers and selection dragging are but two of many ways to enhance this feature.</p>

            <img src="images/visual.png" alt="Visual deconstruction">
            <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
            <p>Footers are often overlooked or completely left out in most of my projects. Ocassionally, I might add one to balance out the page design, but they generally only get a single paragraph with a copyright/credit notice--sometimes social media icons if I'm feeling ambitious. I would like to practive my ability to create and arrange block-level elements in content-rich footer.</p>
            <h4>Degree Connection</h4>
            <p>Footers are important landmarks for both users and screen readers; they allow additional navigation and features that aren't essential or highly sought after, but convenient none-the-less. A content-rich footer has the ability to house contact details (e.g. phone, email), location information (e.g. address, Google Maps), related links (e.g. social media, rss feed), input fields (e.g. search, newsletter sign up), sponsors, copyright, and so much more. Grouping this content together in one place reduces the need for additional pages or sections on a page for presentation. I can enhance the footer by adding JavaScript time/date/location detection to display only pertinent information. (e.g. toll-free numbers if not local, hours if open or closed, etc.)</p>
            <h4>Style Breakdown</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Lato, sans-serif</li>
